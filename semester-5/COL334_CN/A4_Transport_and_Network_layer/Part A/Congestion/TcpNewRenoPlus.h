 *
 * The design is inspired on what Linux v4.0 does (but it has been
 * in place since years). The congestion control is split from the main
 * socket code, and it is a pluggable component. An interface has been defined;
 * variables are maintained in the TcpSocketState class, while subclasses of
 * TcpCongestionOps operate over an instance of that class.
 *
 * Only three methods has been utilized right now; however, Linux has many others,
 * which can be added later in ns-3.
